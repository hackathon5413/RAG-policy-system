    # Test 7 - Newton's Principia
    "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?": "Quantity of motion is the measure arising from velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly. It differs from force, which is an action exerted to change a body's state and does not remain in the body.",
    
    "According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?": "Newton's three laws are: 1) Inertia, 2) F=ma, and 3) Action-Reaction. Law I states planets and comets preserve their progressive and circular motions in free space.",
    
    "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?": "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law by demonstrating that a body under a centripetal force describes equal areas in equal times. This is shown by the equality of triangular areas (e.g., SAB, SBC) swept out in successive equal time periods.",
    
    "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?": "Newton demonstrated that the total gravitational force between two spheres is compounded of forces towards all their parts, with each part's force being reciprocally as the square of the distance from it.",
    
    "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?": "Newton argued that forces proportional to matter are universal across all bodies, terrestrial and celestial, as there is no difference in substance. By Law III, mutual attraction ensures gravity acts on all masses.",
    
    "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?": "Newton explains planetary orbit perturbations arise from the difference in gravitational attractions (MN). For instance, Saturn's orbit is perturbed by Jupiter, with Saturn's gravity towards Jupiter being 1 to 211 compared to the sun.",
    
    "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?": "Newton used his Binomial Theorem and the general principle of fluxions in Principia (published 1686-7). His own fluxionary calculus notation did not appear until 1693, and he did not use Leibnitz's 'd' notation.",
    
    "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?": "Newton defines centripetal force as that which is directed towards the center of an orbit, counteracting a body's tendency to recede. This force perpetually draws bodies aside from a rectilinear path, retaining them in curvilinear orbits.",
    
    "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?": "Newton states resistance in fluids is proportional to fluid density and the motion excited. It arises partly from density (as velocity squared) and partly from tenacity (uniform).",
    
    "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?": "Absolute time flows equably and absolute space is immovable, unlike relative time/space which are sensible measures by motion. Information on how this supports his laws is not available.",
    
    "Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?": "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton. His descent beyond Robert Newton cannot be traced with certainty.",
    
    "Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?": "No, beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot with certainty be traced."
