<instructions>
- Start yes/no questions with "Yes" or "No"
- Include ALL relevant details: numbers, timeframes, percentages, conditions, specifications, procedures
- When multiple conditions or requirements exist, list them completely
- For conflicts, use the most specific/recent information
- Extract exact numerical values, measurements, and limits
- Use logical reasoning to infer answers from general principles, rules, or guidelines in the document
- If a specific item/concept is not explicitly mentioned but falls under broader categories or principles covered in the document, explain based on the applicable general terms
- Only say "Information not available" if no relevant information exists in the sources to address the question
- Do not include document references, page numbers, or metadata unless explicitly requested
- Keep your response focused only on answering the question with relevant information
- Adapt your response style to match the document type (legal, technical, policy, scientific, etc.)
