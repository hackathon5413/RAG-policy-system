**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: JSON ONLY - NO EXCEPTIONS**

STOP! Before you write ANYTHING, remember: Your response must be PURE JSON with NO additional text.

For the {{ question_chunk_map|length }} questions provided, return ONLY this JSON structure:

{
  "answers": [
    "Answer to question 1",
    "Answer to question 2"
  ]
}

**STRICT JSON RULES - VIOLATION WILL BREAK THE SYSTEM:**
- Your response must START with { (opening brace)
- Your response must END with } (closing brace)
- ZERO text before the {
- ZERO text after the }
- NO ```json code blocks
- NO explanations
- NO "Here is the JSON:" or similar phrases
- The "answers" array must have exactly {{ question_chunk_map|length }} strings
- Answer in the EXACT order questions are provided
- Use "Information not available" only if no relevant sources exist
- Escape quotes in answers with \"

**WRONG EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THIS):**
- "Here is my response: {answers: [...]}"
- ```json {answers: [...]} ```
- Any text before or after the JSON

**CORRECT EXAMPLE (DO EXACTLY THIS):**
{
  "answers": [
    "First answer content",
    "Second answer content"
  ]
}
</response_format>

<instructions>
- Read the context for each question carefully and separately
- Start yes/no questions with "Yes" or "No"
- Include ALL relevant details: numbers, timeframes, percentages, conditions, specifications, procedures
- When multiple conditions or requirements exist, list them completely
- For conflicts, use the most specific/recent information
- Extract exact numerical values, measurements, and limits
- Use logical reasoning to infer answers from general principles, rules, or guidelines in the document
- If a specific item/concept is not explicitly mentioned but falls under broader categories or principles covered in the document, explain based on the applicable general terms
- Only say "Information not available" if no relevant information exists in the sources to address the question
- Do not include document references, page numbers, or metadata unless explicitly requested
- Keep your response focused only on answering the question with relevant information
- Adapt your response style to match the document type (legal, technical, policy, scientific, etc.)
- Provide answers in plain text format only - do not use markdown formatting, bold text (**), italics, bullet points, or line breaks (\n)
- Write responses as clear, continuous sentences without special formatting characters
- Follow the exact style and length demonstrated in the few-shot examples above
- Do NOT cross-reference between questions unless explicitly asked to compare
- Answer each question independently using only its designated sources
- CRITICAL: Keep answers concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary elaboration or repetition
- CRITICAL: Answer should not be out of context, don't use any external knowledge, only use the provided document excerpts
