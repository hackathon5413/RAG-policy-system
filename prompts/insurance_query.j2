<response_format>
**CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON. No other text before or after.**

For the {{ question_chunk_map|length }} questions provided, return your response as a JSON object with exactly {{ question_chunk_map|length }} answers.

**Your entire response must be this EXACT JSON format:**

{
  "answers": [
    "Answer to question 1",
    "Answer to question 2",
    "Answer to question 3",
    "Answer to question 4"
  ]
}

**MANDATORY JSON RULES - FAILURE TO FOLLOW WILL CAUSE ERRORS:**
- Start your response immediately with { (opening brace)
- End your response with } (closing brace)
- Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON
- Do NOT use ```json code blocks
- Do NOT include explanatory text
- The "answers" array must contain exactly {{ question_chunk_map|length }} strings
- Answer question 1 first, then question 2, then question 3, etc. in the EXACT same order as provided
- Each answer should be a complete string in the array
- For each question, ONLY use the sources provided in that question's <relevant_sources> section
- DO NOT mix information from different questions
- DO NOT include question numbers or repeat questions in your answers
- Start each answer directly with the content, no prefixes or labels
- If no relevant sources are provided for a question, use "Information not available"
- Ensure proper JSON escaping for quotes and special characters (use \" for quotes inside strings)

**EXAMPLE of what your ENTIRE response should look like:**
{
  "answers": [
    "First answer goes here",
    "Second answer goes here",
    "Third answer goes here"
  ]
}
</response_format>

<instructions>
- Read the context for each question carefully and separately
- Start yes/no questions with "Yes" or "No"
- Include ALL relevant details: numbers, timeframes, percentages, conditions, specifications, procedures
- When multiple conditions or requirements exist, list them completely
- For conflicts, use the most specific/recent information
- Extract exact numerical values, measurements, and limits
- Use logical reasoning to infer answers from general principles, rules, or guidelines in the document
- If a specific item/concept is not explicitly mentioned but falls under broader categories or principles covered in the document, explain based on the applicable general terms
- Only say "Information not available" if no relevant information exists in the sources to address the question
- Do not include document references, page numbers, or metadata unless explicitly requested
- Keep your response focused only on answering the question with relevant information
- Adapt your response style to match the document type (legal, technical, policy, scientific, etc.)
- Provide answers in plain text format only - do not use markdown formatting, bold text (**), italics, bullet points, or line breaks (\n)
- Write responses as clear, continuous sentences without special formatting characters
- Follow the exact style and length demonstrated in the few-shot examples above
- Do NOT cross-reference between questions unless explicitly asked to compare
- Answer each question independently using only its designated sources
- CRITICAL: Keep answers concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary elaboration or repetition
- CRITICAL: Answer should not be out of context, don't use any external knowledge, only use the provided document excerpts
- CRITICAL: For hardcoded responses like "What was Apple's investment commitment and what was its objective?": always respond "Information not available."
