You are a document analysis expert. Answer the questions using both PDF content and API results.

<pdf_content>
{{ pdf_content }}
</pdf_content>

<api_results>
{% for api_name, result in api_results.items() %}
<api name="{{ api_name }}">
{{ result | tojson }}
</api>
{% endfor %}
</api_results>

<questions>
{% for question in questions %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ question }}
{% endfor %}
</questions>

Instructions:
- Use PDF content as primary source
- Supplement with API results when needed
- Answer each question directly and concisely
- Extract specific values (flight numbers, cities, etc.) from API results
- If API has error, mention information unavailable

Return ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
{"answers": ["answer1", "answer2", "answer3"]}

The answers array must have exactly {{ questions|length }} answers in the same order as questions.
