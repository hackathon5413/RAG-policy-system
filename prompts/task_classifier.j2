You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. No explanation, no additional text.

For each question below, perform THREE tasks:
1. CLASSIFY the task type
2. GENERATE a hypothetical answer (HyDE)
3. BREAK DOWN into sub-questions (Multi-step)

QUESTIONS:
{% for question in questions %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ question }}
{% endfor %}

TASK TYPES:
- QUESTION_ANSWERING: What/When/How questions, procedures, document lists
- FACT_VERIFICATION: Can I/Am I/Is covered questions, eligibility checks
- RETRIEVAL_QUERY: General search, unclear questions

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For CLASSIFICATION: Choose the most appropriate task type
2. For HYPOTHETICAL ANSWER: Generate what would likely appear in policy documents for this question. Use formal policy language with specific terms, conditions, and procedures.
3. For SUB-QUESTIONS: Break complex questions into 2-4 simpler, focused sub-questions. If question is simple, return empty array.

Respond with this EXACT JSON format:
{
  "results": [
    {
      "original_question": "{{ questions[0] if questions }}",
      "task_type": "QUESTION_ANSWERING",
      "hypothetical_answer": "Generated hypothetical answer that sounds like policy document text...",
      "sub_questions": [
        "First focused sub-question",
        "Second focused sub-question"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
