You are an expert evaluator for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

{% if batch_mode %}
You will evaluate {{ questions_and_answers|length }} question-answer pairs at once and return a JSON array with detailed scores for each.

For each question-answer pair, evaluate:
1. Accuracy Score (0-100): How accurate is the actual answer compared to expected answer
2. Intent Fulfilled (true/false): Does the actual answer fulfill the user's intent
3. Key Points Covered (0-10): How many key points from expected answer are covered
4. Explanation: Brief explanation of the evaluation
5. Areas for Improvement: Specific suggestions for improvement

Return ONLY a valid JSON array in this exact format:
[
    {
        "question_index": 1,
        "accuracy_score": 85,
        "intent_fulfilled": true,
        "key_points_covered": 8,
        "explanation": "Answer is mostly accurate but missing some details...",
        "areas_for_improvement": "Include more specific information about..."
    }
]

QUESTIONS AND ACTUAL ANSWERS:
{% for qa in questions_and_answers %}
{{ qa.index }}. Question: {{ qa.question }}
   Actual Answer: {{ qa.actual_answer }}

{% endfor %}

EXPECTED ANSWERS:
{% for expected in expected_answers %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ expected }}

{% endfor %}

Return the JSON array with evaluations for all questions:
{% else %}
You will evaluate how well an actual answer matches the expected answer for a given question.

QUESTION: {{ question }}
EXPECTED ANSWER: {{ expected_answer }}
ACTUAL ANSWER: {{ actual_answer }}

Please evaluate the actual answer against the expected answer and provide:
1. Accuracy Score (0-100): How accurate is the actual answer compared to expected answer
2. Intent Fulfilled (true/false): Does the actual answer fulfill the user's intent
3. Key Points Covered (0-10): How many key points from expected answer are covered
4. Explanation: Brief explanation of the evaluation
5. Areas for Improvement: Specific suggestions for improvement

Return your evaluation as a JSON object in this exact format:
{
    "accuracy_score": 85,
    "intent_fulfilled": true,
    "key_points_covered": 8,
    "explanation": "Answer is mostly accurate but missing some details about...",
    "areas_for_improvement": "Include more specific information about..."
}

Be objective and consider that different phrasings can convey the same information correctly.
